   <title>Integrating Weld into other environments</title>

   <para>
      If you want to use Weld in another environment, you will need to provide certain information to Weld via the
      integration SPI. In this Appendix we will briefly discuss the steps needed. 
   </para>

      <title>Enterprise Services</title>
      <para>
         If you just want to use managed beans, and not take advantage of enterprise services (EE resource injection,
         CDI injection into EE component classes, transactional events, support for CDI services in EJBs) and non-flat
         deployments, then the generic servlet support provided by the "Weld: Servlets" extension will be sufficient,
         and will work in any container supporting the Servlet API.
      </para>
   </tip>
    
   <para>
      All SPIs and APIs described have extensive JavaDoc, which spell out the detailed contract between the container
      and Weld.

   <section>
      <title>The Weld SPI</title>
      
      <para>
         The Weld SPI is located in the <literal>weld-spi</literal> module, and packaged as
         <literal>weld-spi.jar</literal>. Some SPIs are optional, and should only be implemented if you need to override
         the default behavior; others are required.
      </para>
       
      <para>
         All interfaces in the SPI support the decorator pattern and provide a <literal>Forwarding</literal> class
         located in the <literal>helpers</literal> sub package. Additional, commonly used, utility classes, and standard
         implementations are also located in the <literal>helpers</literal> sub package.
      </para>
                
      <para>
         Weld supports multiple environments. An environment is defined by an implementation of the
         <literal>Environment</literal> interface. A number of standard environments are built in, and described by the
         <literal>Environments</literal> enumeration. Different environments require different services to be present
         (for example a Servlet container doesn't require transaction, EJB or JPA services). By default an EE
         environment is assumed, but you can adjust the environment by calling
         <literal>bootstrap.setEnvironment()</literal>.
      </para>
         
      <para>
         Weld uses a generic-typed service registry to allow services to be registered. All services implement the
         <literal>Service</literal> interface. The service registry allows services to be added and retrieved.
      </para>
      
      <section>
         <title>Deployment structure</title>
      
         <para>
            An application is often comprised of a number of modules. For example, a Java EE deployment may contain a
            number of EJB modules (containing business logic) and WAR modules (containing the user interface). A
            container may enforce certain <emphasis>accessibility</emphasis> rules which limit the visibility of classes
            between modules. CDI allows these same rules to apply to bean and observer method resolution. As the
            accessibility rules vary between containers, Weld requires the container to <emphasis>describe</emphasis>
            the deployment structure, via the <literal>Deployment</literal> SPI.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The CDI specification discusses <emphasis>Bean Deployment Archives</emphasis> (BDAs)&#8212;archives which
            are marked as containing beans which should be deployed to the CDI container, and made available for
            injection and resolution. Weld reuses this description of <emphasis>Bean Deployment Archives</emphasis> in
            its deployment structure SPI. Each deployment exposes the BDAs which it contains; each BDA may also
            reference other which it can access. Together, the transitive closure of this graph forms the beans which
            are deployed in the application.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            To describe the deployment structure to Weld, the container should provide an implementation of
            <literal>Deployment</literal>.  <literal>Deployment.getBeanDeploymentArchives()</literal> allows Weld to
            discover the modules which make up the application. The CDI specification also allows beans to be specified
            programmatically as part of the bean deployment. These beans may, or may not, be in an existing BDA. For
            this reason, Weld will call <literal>Deployment.loadBeanDeploymentArchive(Class clazz)</literal> for each
            programmatically described bean.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            As programmatically described beans may result in additional BDAs being added to the graph, Weld will
            discover the BDA structure every time an unknown BDA is returned by
            <literal>Deployment.loadBeanDeploymentArchive</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <title>Virtual BDAs</title>
            <para>
               In a strict container, each BDA might have to explicitly specify which other BDAs it can access. However
               many containers will allow an easy mechanism to make BDAs bi-directionally accessible (such as a library
               directory). In this case, it is allowable (and reasonable) to describe all such archives as a single,
               'virtual' <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal>.  
            </para>
            
            <para>
               A container, might, for example, use a flat accessibility structure for the application. In this case, a
               single <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal> would be attached to the <literal>Deployment</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal> provides three methods which allow it's contents to be discovered
            by Weld&#8212;<literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeanClasses()</literal> must return all the classes in the
            BDA, <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeansXml()</literal> must return all the deployment descriptors in
            the archive, and <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getEjbs()</literal> must provide an EJB descriptor for every
            EJB in the BDA, or an empty list if it is not an EJB archive. 
         </para>
         
         <para>
            BDA X may also reference another BDA Y whose beans can be resolved by, and injected into, any bean in BDA X.
            These are the accessible BDAs, and every BDA that is directly accessible by BDA X should be returned.  A BDA
            will also have BDAs which are accessible transitively, and the transitive closure of the sub-graph of BDA X
            describes all the beans resolvable by BDA X.
         </para>
         
         <tip>
            <title>Matching the classloader structure for the deployment</title>
            
            <para>
               In practice, you can regard the deployment structure represented by <literal>Deployment</literal>, and
               the virtual BDA graph as a mirror of the classloader structure for a deployment. If a class can from BDA
               X can be loaded by another in BDA Y, it is accessible, and therefore BDA Y's accessible BDAs should
               include BDA X. 
            </para>
         </tip>
         
         <para>
            To specify the directly accessible BDAs, the container should provide an implementation of
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeanDeploymentArchives()</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <tip>
            <para>
               Weld allows the container to describe a circular graph, and will convert a graph to a tree as part of the
               deployment process.
            </para>
         </tip>
         
         <para>
            Certain services are provided for the whole deployment, whilst some are provided per-BDA. BDA services are
            provided using <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getServices()</literal> and only apply to the BDA on which
            they are provided.
         </para>

      <section>
         <title>EJB descriptors</title>
         
         <para>
            Weld delegates EJB 3 bean discovery to the container so that it doesn't duplicate the work done by the EJB
            container, and respects any vendor-extensions to the EJB definition.
         </para>
               
         <para>
            The <literal>EjbDescriptor</literal> should return the relevant metadata as defined in the EJB
            specification. Each business interface of a session bean should be described using a
            <literal>BusinessInterfaceDescriptor</literal>.
         </para>
         
       </section>
       
       <section>
         <title>EE resource injection and resolution services</title>
         
         <para>
            All the EE resource services are per-BDA services, and may be provided using one of two methods. Which
            method to use is at the discretion of the integrator.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The integrator may choose to provide all EE resource injection services themselves, using another library or
            framework. In this case the integrator should use the <literal>EE</literal> environment, and implement the
            <xref linkend="injection.services" /> SPI.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            Alternatively, the integrator may choose to use CDI to provide EE resource injection. In this case, the
            <literal>EE_INJECT</literal> environment should be used, and the integrator should implement the <xref
            linkend="ejb.services.resolution"/>, <xref linkend="resource.services"/> and <xref linkend="jpa.services"/>.
         </para>
         
         <important>
            <para>
               CDI only provides annotation-based EE resource injection; if you wish to provide deployment descriptor
               (e.g. <literal>ejb-jar.xml</literal>) injection, you must use <xref linkend="injection.services"/>.
            </para>
         </important>
         
         <para>
            If the container performs EE resource injection, the injected resources must be serializable. If EE resource
            injection is provided by Weld, the resolved resource must be serializable.
         </para>
          
         <tip>
            <para>
               If you use a non-EE environment then you may implement any of the EE service SPIs, and Weld will provide
               the associated functionality. There is no need to implement those services you don't need!

            returns a wrapper&#8212;<literal>SessionObjectReference</literal>&#8212;around the EJB reference. This
            wrapper allows Weld to request a reference that implements the given business interface, and, in the case of
            SFSBs, both request the removal of the EJB from the container and query whether the EJB has been previously

            When a client makes a request to an application which uses Weld, the request may be addressed at any of the
            BDAs in the application deployment. To allow Weld to correctly service the request, it needs to know which
            BDA the request is addressed at.  Where possible, Weld will provide some context, but use of these by the

            The <literal>org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Bootstrap</literal> interface defines the initialization for Weld,
            bean deployment and bean validation. To boot Weld, you must create an instance of
            <literal>org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.WeldBeansBootstrap</literal> (which implements
            <literal>Boostrap</literal>), tell it about the services in use, and then request the container start.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The bootstrap is split into phases, container initialization, bean deployment, bean validation and shutdown.
            Initialization will create a manager, and add the built-in contexts, and examine the deployment structure.
            Bean deployment will deploy any beans (defined using annotations, programtically, or built in). Bean
            validation will validate all beans.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            To initialize the container, you call <literal>Bootstrap.startInitialization()</literal>. Before calling
            <literal>startInitialization()</literal>, you must register any services required by the environment. You
            can do this by calling, for example, <literal>bootstrap.getServices().add(JpaServices.class, new
            MyJpaServices())</literal>.  You must also provide the application context bean store.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            Having called <literal>startInitialization()</literal>, the <literal>Manager</literal> for each BDA can be
            obtained by calling <literal>Bootstrap.getManager(BeanDeploymentArchive bda)</literal>.

         <para>
            To deploy the discovered beans, call <literal>Bootstrap.deployBeans()</literal>.

         <para>
            To validate the deployed beans, call <literal>Bootstrap.validateBeans()</literal>.

            Weld needs to load classes and resources from the classpath at various times. By default, they are loaded
            from the Thread Context ClassLoader if available, if not the same classloader that was used to load Weld,
            however this may not be correct for some environments. If this is case, you can implement
            <literal>org.jboss.weld.spi.ResourceLoader</literal>.

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  The CDI specification requires the container to provide injection into non-contextual resources for
                  all Java EE component classes. Weld delegates this responsibility to the container. This can be
                  achieved using the CDI defined <literal>InjectionTarget</literal> SPI. Furthermore, you must perform
                  this operation on the correct bean manager for the bean deployment archive containing the EE component
                  class.

                  The CDI specification also requires that a <literal>ProcessInjectionTarget</literal> event is fired

                  <literal>ProcessInjectionTarget.setInjectionTarget()</literal> the container must use <emphasis>the
