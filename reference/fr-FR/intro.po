"jump through! The good news is that you've probably already written and used "

"Prior to Java EE 6, there was no clear definition of the term \"bean\" in "
"the Java EE platform. Of course, we've been calling Java classes used in web "
"and enterprise applications \"beans\" for years. There were even a couple of "
"different kinds of things called \"beans\" in EE specifications, including "
"EJB beans and JSF managed beans. Meanwhile, other third-party frameworks "
"such as Spring and Seam introduced their own ideas of what it meant to be a "
"\"bean\". What we've been missing is a common definition."

"Java EE 6 finally lays down that common definition in the Managed Beans "
"specification. Managed Beans are defined as container-managed objects with "
"minimal programming restrictions, otherwise known by the acronym POJO (Plain "
"Old Java Object). They support a small set of basic services, such as "
"resource injection, lifecycle callbacks and interceptors. Companion "
"specifications, such as EJB and CDI, build on this basic model. But, "
"<emphasis>at last</emphasis>, there's a uniform concept of a bean and a "
"lightweight component model that's aligned across the Java EE platform."

"With very few exceptions, almost every concrete Java class that has a "

"JavaBean and every EJB session bean. If you've already got some JavaBeans or "
"session beans lying around, they're already beans&#8212;you won't need any "
"additional special metadata. There's just little one thing you need to do "
"before you can start injecting them into stuff: you need to put them in an "
"archive (a jar, or a Java EE module such as a war or EJB jar) that contains "
"a special marker file: <literal>META-INF/beans.xml</literal>."
