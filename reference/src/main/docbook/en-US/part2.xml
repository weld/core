      Weld provides a complete SPI allowing Java EE containers such as JBoss AS and GlassFish to use Weld as their 
      built-in CDI implementation. Weld also runs in servlet engines like Tomcat and Jetty, or even in a plain Java SE 
      environment.
   </para>

      Weld comes with an extensive library of examples, which are a great starting point from which to learn CDI.
