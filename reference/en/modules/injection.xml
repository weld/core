  <title>Dependency injection</title>

<para>Web Beans supports three primary mechanisms for dependency injection:</para>

<para>Constructor parameter injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class Checkout {
        
    private final ShoppingCart cart;
    
    @Initializer
    public Checkout(ShoppingCart cart) {
        this.cart = cart;
    }

}]]></programlisting>

<para><emphasis>Initializer</emphasis> method parameter injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class Checkout {
        
    private ShoppingCart cart;

    @Initializer 
    void setShoppingCart(ShoppingCart cart) {
        this.cart = cart;
    }
    
}]]></programlisting>

<para>And direct field injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class Checkout {

    private @Current ShoppingCart cart;
    
}]]></programlisting>

<para>Dependency injection always occurs when the Web Bean instance is first 
instantiated.</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>First, the Web Bean manager calls the Web Bean constructor, to
    obtain an instance of the Web Bean.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Next, the Web Bean manager initializes the values of all injected
    fields of the Web Bean.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Next, the Web Bean manager calls all initializer methods of Web 
    Bean.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>Finally, the <literal>@PostConstruct</literal> method of the Web 
    Bean, if any, is called.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Constructor parameter injection is not supported for EJB beans, since
the EJB is instantiated by the EJB container, not the Web Bean manager.</para>

<para>Parameters of constructors and initializer methods need not be explicitly
annotated when the default binding type <literal>@Current</literal> applies. 
Injected fields, however, <emphasis>must</emphasis> specify a binding type, even 
when the default binding type applies. If the field does not specify a binding
type, it will not be injected.</para>

<para>Producer methods also support parameter injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Produces Checkout createCheckout(ShoppingCart cart) {
    return new Checkout(cart);
}]]></programlisting>

<para>Finally, observer methods (which we'll meet in <xref linkend="events"/>), 
disposal methods and destructor methods all support parameter injection.</para>

<para>The Web Beans specification defines a procedure, called the <emphasis>typesafe
resolution algorithm</emphasis>, that the Web Bean manager follows when identifying 
the Web Bean to inject to an injection point. This algorithm looks complex at first, 
but once you understand it, it's really quite intuitive. Typesafe resolution is 
performed at system initialization time, which means that the manager will inform 
the user immediately if a Web Bean's dependencies cannot be satisfied, by throwing
a <literal>UnsatisfiedDependencyException</literal> or 
<literal>AmbiguousDependencyException</literal>.</para>

<para>The purpose of this algorithm is to allow multiple Web Beans to implement the
same API type and either:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>allow the client to select which implementation it requires using 
    <emphasis>binding annotations</emphasis>,
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>allow the application deployer to select which implementation is appropriate 
    for a particular deployment, without changes to the client, by enabling or 
    disabling <emphasis>deployment types</emphasis>, or</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>allow one implementation of an API to override another implementation of 
    the same API at deployment time, without changes to the client, using 
    <emphasis>deployment type precedence</emphasis>.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Let's explore how the Web Beans manager determines a Web Bean to be injected.</para>

<section>
  <title>Binding annotations</title>

<para>If we have more than one Web Bean that implements a particular API type, the 
injection point can specify exactly which Web Bean should be injected using a binding 
annotation. For example, there might be two implementations of 
<literal>PaymentProcessor</literal>:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@PayByCheque
public class ChequePaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(Payment payment) { ... }
}]]></programlisting>      

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@PayByCreditCard
public class CreditCardPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void process(Payment payment) { ... }
}]]></programlisting>

<para>Where <literal>@PayByCheque</literal> and <literal>@PayByCreditCard</literal> 
are binding annotations:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
@BindingType
public @interface PayByCheque {}]]></programlisting>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
@BindingType
public @interface PayByCreditCard {}]]></programlisting>

<para>A client Web Bean developer uses the binding annotation to specify exactly which 
Web Bean should be injected.</para>

<para>Using field injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@PayByCheque PaymentProcessor chequePaymentProcessor;
@PayByCreditCard PaymentProcessor creditCardPaymentProcessor;]]></programlisting>

<para>Using initializer method injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Initializer
public void setPaymentProcessors(@PayByCheque PaymentProcessor chequePaymentProcessor, 
                                 @PayByCreditCard PaymentProcessor creditCardPaymentProcessor) {
   this.chequePaymentProcessor = chequePaymentProcessor;
   this.creditCardPaymentProcessor = creditCardPaymentProcessor;
}]]></programlisting>

<para>Or using constructor injection:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Initializer
public Checkout(@PayByCheque PaymentProcessor chequePaymentProcessor, 
                @PayByCreditCard PaymentProcessor creditCardPaymentProcessor) {
   this.chequePaymentProcessor = chequePaymentProcessor;
   this.creditCardPaymentProcessor = creditCardPaymentProcessor;
}]]></programlisting>

<section>
  <title>Binding annotations with members</title>

  <para>Binding annotations may have members:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
@BindingType
public @interface PayBy {
    PaymentType value();
}]]></programlisting>

  <para>In which case, the member value is significant:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@PayBy(CHEQUE) PaymentProcessor chequePaymentProcessor;
@PayBy(CREDIT_CARD) PaymentProcessor creditCardPaymentProcessor;]]></programlisting>

  <para>You can tell the Web Bean manager to ignore a member of a binding annotation
  type by annotating the member <literal>@NonBinding</literal>.</para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Combinations of binding annnotations</title>

  <para>An injection point may even specify multiple binding annotations:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Asynchronous @PayByCheque PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor]]></programlisting>

  <para>In this case, only a Web Bean which has <emphasis>both</emphasis> binding 
  annotations would be eligible for injection.</para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Binding annotations and producer methods</title>

<para>Even producer methods may specify binding annotations:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Produces 
@Asynchronous @PayByCheque 
PaymentProcessor createAsyncPaymentProcessor(@PayByCheque PaymentProcessor processor) {
    return new AsynchronousPaymentProcessor(processor);
}]]></programlisting>

</section>

<section>
  <title>The default binding type</title>
  
  <para>Web Beans defines a binding type <literal>@Current</literal> that is the 
  default binding type for any injection point or Web Bean that does not explicitly
  specify a binding type.</para>
  
  <para>There are two common circumstances in which it is necessary to explicitly 
  specify <literal>@Current</literal>:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>on a field, in order to declare it as an injected field with the
      default binding type, and</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>on a Web Bean which has another binding type in addition to the
      default binding type.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
</section>
  
</section>

<section id="deploymenttypes">
  <title>Deployment types</title>

  <para>All Web Beans have a <emphasis>deployment type</emphasis>. Each deployment 
  type identifies a set of Web Beans that should be conditionally installed in some 
  deployments of the system.</para>

  <para>For example, we could define a deployment type named <literal>@Mock</literal>, 
  which would identify Web Beans that should only be installed when the system executes
  inside an integration testing environment:</para>

  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Retention(RUNTIME)
  @Target({TYPE, METHOD})
  @DeploymentType
  public @interface Mock {}]]></programlisting>

  <para>Suppose we had some Web Bean that interacted with an external system to
  process payments:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public class ExternalPaymentProcessor {
        
    public void process(Payment p) {
        ...
    }
    
}]]></programlisting>

  <para>Since this Web Bean does not explicitly specify a deployment type, it has the
  default deployment type <literal>@Production</literal>.</para>

  <para>For integration or unit testing, the external system is slow or unavailable.
  So we would create a mock object:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Mock 
public class MockPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {

    @Override
    public void process(Payment p) {
        p.setSuccessful(true);
    }

}]]></programlisting>

  <para>But how does the Web Bean manager determine which implementation to use in
  a particular deployment?</para>

<section>
  <title>Enabling deployment types</title>

  <para>Web Beans defines two built-in deployment types: <literal>@Production</literal> 
  and <literal>@Standard</literal>. By default, only Web Beans with the built-in deployment 
  types are enabled when the system is deployed. We can identify additional deployment 
  types to be enabled in a particular deployment by listing them in 
  <literal>web-beans.xml</literal>.</para>

  <para>Going back to our example, when we deploy our integration tests, we want all 
  our <literal>@Mock</literal> objects to be installed:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[<WebBeans>
    <Deploy>
        <Standard/>
        <Production/>
        <test:Mock/>
    </Deploy>
</WebBeans>]]></programlisting>

  <para>Now the Web Bean manager will identify and install all Web Beans annotated
  <literal>@Production</literal>, <literal>@Standard</literal> or <literal>@Mock</literal> 
  at deployment time.</para>
  
  <para>The deployment type <literal>@Standard</literal> is used only for certain
  special Web Beans defined by the Web Beans specification. We can't use it for
  our own Web Beans, and we can't disable it.</para>
  
  <para>The deployment type <literal>@Production</literal> is the default deployment
  type for Web Beans which don't explicitly declare a deployment type, and may be
  disabled.</para>
  
</section>

<section>
  <title>Deployment type precedence</title>

<para>If you've been paying attention, you're probably wondering how the Web Bean 
manager decides which implementation&#151;<literal>ExternalPaymentProcessor</literal> 
or <literal>MockPaymentProcessor</literal>&#151;to choose. Consider what happens when 
the manager encounters this injection point:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Current PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor]]></programlisting>

<para>There are now two Web Beans which satisfy the <literal>PaymentProcessor</literal> 
contract. Of course, we can't use a binding annotation to disambiguate, since binding 
annotations are hard-coded into the source at the injection point, and we want the 
manager to be able to decide at deployment time!</para>

<para>The solution to this problem is that each deployment type has a different
<emphasis>precedence</emphasis>. The precedence of the deployment types is determined 
by the order in which they appear in <literal>web-beans.xml</literal>. In our example, 
<literal>@Mock</literal> appears later than <literal>@Production</literal> so it 
has a higher precedence.</para>

<para>Whenever the manager discovers that more than one Web Bean could satisfy the 
contract (API type plus binding annotations) specified by an injection point, it 
considers the relative precedence of the Web Beans. If one has a higher precedence 
than the others, it chooses the higher precedence Web Bean to inject. So, in our example, 
the Web Bean manager will inject <literal>MockPaymentProcessor</literal> when executing 
in our integration testing environment (which is exactly what we want).</para>

<para>It's interesting to compare this facility to today's popular manager 
architectures. Various "lightweight" containers also allow conditional deployment 
of classes that exist in the classpath, but the classes that are to be deployed 
must be explicity, individually, listed in configuration code or in some XML 
configuration file. Web Beans does support Web Bean definition and configuration 
via XML, but in the common case where no complex configuration is required, deployment 
types allow a whole set of Web Beans to be enabled with a single line of XML.
Meanwhile, a developer browsing the code can easily identify what deployment
scenarios the Web Bean will be used in.</para>

  <title>Example deployment types</title>

<para>Deployment types are useful for all kinds of things, here's some examples:</para>

    specification</para>

<section>
  <title>Fixing unsatisfied dependencies</title>
  
  <para>The typesafe resolution algorithm fails when, after considering the binding 
  annotations and and deployment types of all Web Beans that implement the API type
  of an injection point, the Web Bean manager is unable to identify exactly one
  Web Bean to inject.</para>
  
  <para>It's usually easy to fix an <literal>UnsatisfiedDependencyException</literal> or 
  <literal>AmbiguousDependencyException</literal>.</para>
  
  <para>To fix an <literal>UnsatisfiedDependencyException</literal>, simply provide 
  a Web Bean which implements the API type and has the binding types of the injection
  point&#151;or enable the deployment type of a Web Bean that already implements the 
  API type and has the binding types.</para>
  
  <para>To fix an <literal>AmbiguousDependencyException</literal>, introduce a 
  binding type to distinguish between the two implementations of the API type,
  or change the deployment type of one of the implementations so that the Web
  Bean manager can use deployment type precedence to choose between them. An
  <literal>AmbiguousDependencyException</literal> can only occur if two Web Beans
  share a binding type and have exactly the same deployment type.</para>
  
  <para>There's one more issue you need to be aware of when using dependency injection
  in Web Beans.</para>

</section>

<section>
  <title>Client proxies</title>
  
  <para>Clients of an injected Web Bean do not usually hold a direct reference to
  a Web Bean instance.</para> 
  
  <para>Imagine that a Web Bean bound to the application scope held a direct reference 
  to a Web Bean bound to the request scope. The application scoped Web Bean is shared 
  between many different requests. However, each request should see a different instance
  of the request scoped Web bean!</para>
  
  <para>Now imagine that a Web Bean bound to the session scope held a direct reference
  to a Web Bean bound to the application scope. From time to time, the session context
  is serialized to disk in order to use memory more efficiently. However, the application
  scoped Web Bean instance should not be serialized along with the session scoped Web
  Bean!</para>
  
  <para>Therefore, unless a Web Bean has the default scope <literal>@Dependent</literal>, 
  the Web Bean manager must indirect all injected references to the Web Bean through a 
  proxy object. This <emphasis>client proxy</emphasis> is responsible for ensuring that 
  the Web Bean instance that receives a method invocation is the instance that is
  associated with the current context. The client proxy also allows Web Beans bound
  to contexts such as the session context to be serialized to disk without recursively
  serializing other injected Web Beans.</para>
  
  <para>Unfortunately, due to limitations of the Java language, some Java types cannot
  be proxied by the Web Bean manager. Therefore, the Web Bean manager throws an
  <literal>UnproxyableDependencyException</literal> if the type of an injection point
  cannot be proxied.</para>
  
  <para>The following Java types cannot be proxied by the Web Bean manager:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>classes which are declared <literal>final</literal> or have a 
      <literal>final</literal> method,</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>classes which have no non-private constructor with no parameters, and</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>arrays and primitive types.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>It's usually very easy to fix an <literal>UnproxyableDependencyException</literal>.
  Simply add a constructor with no parameters to the injected class, introduce an interface, 
  or change the scope of the injected Web Bean to <literal>@Dependent</literal>.</para>

<section>
  <title>Obtaining a Web Bean by programatic lookup</title>
  
  <para>The application may obtain an instance of the interface <literal>Manager</literal>
  by injection:</para>
  
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Current Manager manager;]]></programlisting>
  
  <para>The <literal>Manager</literal> object provides a set of methods for obtaining a
  Web Bean instance programatically.</para>
  
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[PaymentProcessor p = manager.getInstanceByType(PaymentProcessor.class);]]></programlisting>
  
  <para>Binding annotations may be specified by subclassing the helper class 
  <literal>AnnotationLiteral</literal>, since it is otherwise difficult to instantiate an
  annotation type in Java.</para>
  
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[PaymentProcessor p = manager.getInstanceByType(PaymentProcessor.class, 
                                               new AnnotationLiteral<CreditCard>(){});]]></programlisting>
  
  <para>If the binding type has an annotation member, we can't use an anonymous subclass of 
  <literal>AnnotationLiteral</literal>&#151;instead we'll need to create a named subclass:</para>
  
<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[abstract class CreditCardBinding 
    extends AnnotationLiteral<CreditCard> 
    implements CreditCard {}]]></programlisting>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[PaymentProcessor p = manager.getInstanceByType(PaymentProcessor.class, 
                                               new CreditCardBinding() { 
                                                   public void value() { return paymentType; } 
                                               } );]]></programlisting>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Lifecycle callbacks, <literal>@Resource</literal>, <literal>@EJB</literal> and
  <literal>@PersistenceContext</literal></title>
  
  <para>Enterprise Web Beans support all the lifecycle callbacks defined by the EJB
  specification: <literal>@PostConstruct</literal>, <literal>@PreDestroy</literal>,
  <literal>@PrePassivate</literal> and <literal>@PostActivate</literal>.</para>
  
  <para>Simple Web Beans support only the <literal>@PostConstruct</literal> and 
  <literal>@PreDestroy</literal> callbacks.</para>
  
  <para>Both enterprise and simple Web Beans support the use of <literal>@Resource</literal>, 
  <literal>@EJB</literal> and <literal>@PersistenceContext</literal> for injection of Java
  EE resources, EJBs and JPA persistence contexts, respectively. Simple Web Beans do not 
  support the use of <literal>@PersistenceContext(type=EXTENDED)</literal>.</para>
  
  <para>The <literal>@PostConstruct</literal> callback always occurs after all dependencies
  have been injected.</para>
  
</section>

<section>
  <title>The <literal>InjectionPoint</literal> object</title>
  
  <para>There are certain kinds of dependent objects&#151;Web Beans with scope 
  <literal>@Dependent</literal>&#151;that need to know something about the object or injection 
  point into which they are injected in order to be able to do what they do. For example:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>The log category for a <literal>Logger</literal> depends upon the class of the object 
      that owns it.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Injection of a HTTP parameter or header value depends upon what parameter 
      or header name was specified at the injection point.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Injection of the result of an EL expression evaluation depends upon the 
      expression that was specified at the injection point.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>A Web Bean with scope <literal>@Dependent</literal> may inject an instance of 
  <literal>InjectionPoint</literal> and access metadata relating to the injection point to which 
  it belongs.</para>

  <para>Let's look at an example. The following code is verbose, and vulnerable to refactoring
  problems:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[Logger log = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName());]]></programlisting>

  <para>This clever little producer method lets you inject a JDK <literal>Logger</literal> without 
  explicitly specifying the log category:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[class LogFactory {

   @Produces Logger createLogger(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) { 
      return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName()); 
   }

}]]></programlisting>

  <para>We can now write:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Current Logger log;]]></programlisting>

  <para>Not convinced? Then here's a second example. To inject HTTP parameters, we need to define 
  a binding type:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@BindingType
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD, PARAMETER})
public @interface HttpParam {
   @NonBinding public String value();
}]]></programlisting>

  <para>We would use this binding type at injection points as follows:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@HttpParam("username") String username;
@HttpParam("password") String password;]]></programlisting>

  <para>The following producer method does the work:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[class HttpParams

   @Produces @HttpParam("")
   String getParamValue(ServletRequest request, InjectionPoint ip) {
      return request.getParameter(ip.getAnnotation(HttpParam.class).value());
   }

}]]></programlisting>

  <para>(Note that the <literal>value()</literal> member of the <literal>HttpParam</literal>
  annotation is ignored by the Web Bean manager since it is annotated <literal>@NonBinding.</literal>)</para>

<para>The Web Bean manager provides a built-in Web Bean that implements the
<literal>InjectionPoint</literal> interface:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface InjectionPoint { 
   public Object getInstance(); 
   public Bean<?> getBean(); 
   public Member getMember(): 
   public <T extends Annotation> T getAnnotation(Class<T> annotation); 
   public Set<T extends Annotation> getAnnotations(); 
}]]></programlisting>
