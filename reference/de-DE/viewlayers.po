"created and set as the response target through <literal>setResponsePage()</"
"literal>, this new page will also participate in this conversation. This "
"occurs for both directly instantiated pages (<literal>setResponsePage(new "
"OtherPage())</literal>), as well as for bookmarkable pages created with "
"<literal>setResponsePage(OtherPage.class)</literal> where <literal>OtherPage."
"class</literal> is mounted as bookmarkable from your "
"<literal>WebApplication</literal> subclass (or through annotations). In the "
"latter case, because the new page instance is not created until after a "
"redirect, the conversation id will be propagated through a request "
"parameter, and then stored in page metadata after the redirect."
