"Shortly before the final draft of JSR-299 was submitted, the specification "
"changed its name from \"Web Beans\" to \"Java Contexts and Dependency "
"Injection for the Java EE platform\", abbreviated CDI. For a brief period "
"after the renaming, the reference implementation adopted the name \"Web Beans"
"\". However, this ended up causing more confusion than it solved and Red Hat "
"decided to change the name of the reference implementation to \"Weld\". You "
"may still find other documentation, blogs, forum posts, etc. that use the "
"old nomenclature. Please update any references you can. The naming game is "
"over."

"You'll also find that some of the functionality that once existed in the "
"specification is now missing, such as defining beans in XML. These features "
"will be available as portable extensions for CDI in the Weld project, and "
"perhaps other implementations."

"Note that this reference guide was started while changes were still being "
"made to the specification. We've done our best to update it for accuracy. If "
"you discover a conflict between what is written in this guide and the "
"specification, the specification is the authority&#8212;assume it is "
"correct. If you believe you have found an error in the specification, please "
"report it to the JSR-299 EG."
