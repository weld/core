If you really want to be able to inject these objects, it&#39;s easy to create a portable extension to expose them as beans. However, we recommend that direct access to these objects be limited to servlets, servlet filters and servlet event listeners, where they may be obtained in the usual way as defined by the Java Servlets spec. The <literal>FacesContext</literal> is also not injectable. You can get at it by calling <literal>FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()</literal>."
