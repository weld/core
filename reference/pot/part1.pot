"The CDI services are a core aspect of the Java EE platform and include full "
"support for Java EE modularity and the Java EE component architecture. But "
"the specification does not limit the use of CDI to the Java EE environment. "
"In the Java SE environment, the services might be provided by a standalone "
"CDI implementation like Weld (see <xref linkend=\"weld-se\"/>), or even by a "
"container that also implements the subset of EJB defined for embedded usage "
"by the EJB 3.1 specification. CDI is especially useful in the context of web "
"application development, but the problems it solves are general development "
"concerns and it is therefore applicable to a wide variety of application."

"A bean specifies only the type and semantics of other beans it depends upon. "
"It need not be aware of the actual lifecycle, concrete implementation, "
"threading model or other clients of any bean it interacts with. Even better, "
"the concrete implementation, lifecycle and threading model of a bean may "
"vary according to the deployment scenario, without affecting any client. "
"This loose-coupling makes your code easier to maintain."

"What's even more powerful (and comforting) is that CDI provides all these "
"facilities in a <emphasis>typesafe</emphasis> way. CDI never relies on "
"string-based identifiers to determine how collaborating objects fit "
"together. Instead, CDI uses the typing information that is already available "
"in the Java object model, augmented using a new programming pattern, called "
"<emphasis>qualifier annotations</emphasis>, to wire together beans, their "
"dependencies, their interceptors and decorators, and their event consumers. "
"Usage of XML descriptors is minimized to truly deployment-specific "
"information."

"But CDI isn't a restrictive programming model. It doesn't tell you how you "

"CDI even provides a comprehensive SPI, allowing other kinds of object "

"CDI was influenced by a number of existing Java frameworks, including Seam, "
"Guice and Spring. However, CDI has its own, very distinct, character: more "
"typesafe than Seam, more stateful and less XML-centric than Spring, more web "
"and enterprise-application capable than Guice. But it couldn't have been any "
"of these without inspiration from the frameworks mentioned and "
"<emphasis>lots</emphasis> of collaboration and hard work by the JSR-299 "
"Expert Group (EG)."
