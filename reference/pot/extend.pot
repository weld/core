msgid "We recommend that frameworks let CDI take over the job of actually instantiating the framework-controlled objects. That way, the framework-controlled objects can take advantage of constructor injection. However, if the framework requires use of a constructor with a special signature, the framework will need to instatiate the object itself, and so only method and field injection will be supported."
