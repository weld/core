"Interceptors are a powerful way to capture and separate concerns which are "
"<emphasis>orthogonal</emphasis> to the application (and type system). Any "
"interceptor is able to intercept invocations of any Java type. This makes "
"them perfect for solving technical concerns such as transaction management, "
"security and call logging. However, by nature, interceptors are unaware of "
"the actual semantics of the events they intercept. Thus, interceptors aren't "
"an appropriate tool for separating business-related concerns."

"The reverse is true of <emphasis>decorators</emphasis>. A decorator "
"intercepts invocations only for a certain Java interface, and is therefore "
"aware of all the semantics attached to that interface. Since decorators "
"directly implement operations with business semantics, it makes them the "
"perfect tool for modeling some kinds of business concerns. It also means "
"that a decorator doesn't have the generality of an interceptor. Decorators "
"aren't able to solve technical concerns that cut across many disparate "
"types. Interceptors and decorators, though similar in many ways, are "
"complementary. Let's look at some cases where decorators fit the bill."
