msgid "Interceptors are a powerful way to capture and separate concerns which are <emphasis>orthogonal</emphasis> to the application (and type system). Any interceptor is able to intercept invocations of any Java type. This makes them perfect for solving technical concerns such as transaction management, security and call logging. However, by nature, interceptors are unaware of the actual semantics of the events they intercept. Thus, interceptors aren't an appropriate tool for separating business-related concerns."

#. Tag: para

msgid "The reverse is true of <emphasis>decorators</emphasis>. A decorator intercepts invocations only for a certain Java interface, and is therefore aware of all the semantics attached to that interface. Since decorators directly implement operations with business semantics, it makes them the perfect tool for modeling some kinds of business concerns. It also means that a decorator doesn't have the generality of an interceptor. Decorators aren't able to solve technical concerns that cut across many disparate types. Interceptors and decorators, though similar in many ways, are complementary. Let's look at some cases where decorators fit the bill."

msgid "Several different beans in our system implement the <literal>Account</literal> interface. However, we have a common legal requirement that; for any kind of account, large transactions must be recorded by the system in a special log. This is a perfect job for a decorator."

msgid "Unlike other beans, a decorator may be an abstract class. Therefore, if there's nothing special the decorator needs to do for a particular method of the decorated interface, you don't need to implement that method."

msgid "Decorators have a special injection point, called the <emphasis>delegate injection point</emphasis>, with the same type as the beans they decorate, and the annotation <literal>@Delegate</literal>. There must be exactly one delegate injection point, which can be a constructor parameter, initializer method parameter or injected field."

msgid "A delegate injection point may specify any number of qualifier annotations. The decorator will only be bound to beans with the same qualifiers."

#. Tag: para

msgid "The decorator may invoke the delegate object, which has much the same effect as calling <literal>InvocationContext.proceed()</literal> from an interceptor. The main difference is that the decorator can invoke <emphasis>any</emphasis> business method on the delegate object."
