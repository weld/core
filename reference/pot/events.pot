msgid "Dependency injection enables loose-coupling by allowing the implementation of the injected bean type to vary, either a deployment time or runtime. Events go one step further, allowing beans to interact with no compile time dependency at all. Event <emphasis>producers</emphasis> raise events that are delivered to event <emphasis>observers</emphasis> by the container."

msgid "The event object carries state from producer to consumer. The event object is nothing more than an instance of a concrete Java class. (The only restriction is that an event type may not contain type variables). An event may be assigned qualifiers, which allows observers to distinguish it from other events of the same type. The qualifiers function like topic selectors, allowing an observer to narrow the set of events it observes."
