msgid "So you're keen to get started writing your first bean? Or perhaps you're skeptical, wondering what kinds of hoops the CDI specification will make you jump through! The good news is that you've probably already written and used hundreds, perhaps thousands of beans. CDI just makes it easier to actually use them to build an application!"

msgid "Prior to Java EE 6, there was no clear definition of the term \"bean\" in the Java EE platform. Of course, we've been calling Java classes used in web and enterprise applications \"beans\" for years. There were even a couple of different kinds of things called \"beans\" in EE specifications, including EJB beans and JSF managed beans. Meanwhile, other third-party frameworks such as Spring and Seam introduced their own ideas of what it meant to be a \"bean\". What we've been missing is a common definition."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "Java EE 6 finally lays down that common definition in the Managed Beans specification. Managed Beans are defined as container-managed objects with minimal programming restrictions, otherwise known by the acronym POJO (Plain Old Java Object). They support a small set of basic services, such as resource injection, lifecycle callbacks and interceptors. Companion specifications, such as EJB and CDI, build on this basic model. But, <emphasis>at last</emphasis>, there's a uniform concept of a bean and a lightweight component model that's aligned across the Java EE platform."

msgid "With very few exceptions, almost every concrete Java class that has a constructor with no parameters (or a constructor designated with the annotation <literal>@Inject</literal>) is a bean. This includes every JavaBean and every EJB session bean. If you've already got some JavaBeans or session beans lying around, they're already beans—you won't need any additional special metadata. There's just little one thing you need to do before you can start injecting them into stuff: you need to put them in an archive (a jar, or a Java EE module such as a war or EJB jar) that contains a special marker file: <literal>META-INF/beans.xml</literal>."

#. Tag: para

msgid "The JavaBeans and EJBs you've been writing every day, up until now, have not been able to take advantage of the new services defined by the CDI specification. But you'll be able to use every one of them with CDI—allowing the container to create and destroy instances of your beans and associate them with a designated context, injecting them into other beans, using them in EL expressions, specializing them with qualifier annotations, even adding interceptors and decorators to them—without modifying your existing code. At most, you'll need to add some annotations."

msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "But wait! <literal>TextTranslator</literal> does not have a constructor with no parameters! Is it still a bean? If you remember, a class that does not have a constructor with no parameters can still be a bean if it has a constructor annotated <literal>@Inject</literal>."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "As you've guessed, the <literal>@Inject</literal> annotation has something to do with dependency injection! <literal>@Inject</literal> may be applied to a constructor or method of a bean, and tells the container to call that constructor or method when instantiating the bean. The container will inject other beans into the parameters of the constructor or method."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "We may obtain an instance of <literal>TextTranslator</literal> by injecting it into a constructor, method or field of a bean, or a field or method of a Java EE component class such as a servlet. The container chooses the object to be injected based on the type of the injection point, not the name of the field, method or parameter."

msgid "Notice the controller bean is request-scoped and named. Since this combination is so common in web applications, there's a built-in annotation for it in CDI that we could have used as a shorthand. When the (stereotype) annotation <literal>@Model</literal> is declared on a class, it creates a request-scoped and named bean."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

msgid "Alternatively, we may obtain an instance of <literal>TextTranslator</literal> programmatically from an injected instance of <literal>Instance</literal>, parameterized with the bean type:"
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "Notice that it isn't necessary to create a getter or setter method to inject one bean into another. CDI can access an injected field directly (even if it's private!), which sometimes helps eliminate some wasteful code. The name of the field is arbitrary. It's the field's type that determines what is injected."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "At system initialization time, the container must validate that exactly one bean exists which satisfies each injection point. In our example, if no implementation of <literal>Translator</literal> is available—if the <literal>SentenceTranslator</literal> EJB was not deployed—the container would inform us of an <emphasis>unsatisfied dependency</emphasis>. If more than one implementation of <literal>Translator</literal> were available, the container would inform us of the <emphasis>ambiguous dependency</emphasis>."

msgid "Before we get too deep in the details, let's pause and examine a bean's anatomy. What aspects of the bean are significant, and what gives it its identity? Instead of just giving examples of beans, we're going to define what <emphasis>makes</emphasis> something a bean."
