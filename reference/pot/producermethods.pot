msgid "In particular, producer methods let us use runtime polymorphism with CDI. As we&#39;ve seen, alternative beans are one solution to the problem of deployment-time polymorphism. But once the system is deployed, the CDI implementation is fixed. A producer method has no such limitation:"

msgid "Consider an injection point:"
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "This injection point has the same type and qualifier annotations as the producer method, so it resolves to the producer method using the usual CDI injection rules. The producer method will be called by the container to obtain an instance to service this injection point."

msgid "The scope of the producer method defaults to <literal>@Dependent</literal>, and so it will be called <emphasis>every time</emphasis> the container injects this field or any other field that resolves to the same producer method. Thus, there could be multiple instances of the <literal>PaymentStrategy</literal> object for each user session."

msgid "A producer method does <emphasis>not</emphasis> inherit the scope of the bean that declares the method. There are two different beans here: the producer method, and the bean which declares it. The scope of the producer method determines how often the method will be called, and the lifecycle of the objects returned by the method. The scope of the bean that declares the producer method determines the lifecycle of the object upon which the producer method is invoked."

Objects instantiated directly by the application can&#39;t take advantage of dependency injection and don&#39;t have interceptors."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

msgid "If this isn&#39;t what we want, we can use dependency injection into the producer method to obtain bean instances:"
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "Wait, what if <literal>CreditCardPaymentStrategy</literal> is a request-scoped bean? Then the producer method has the effect of &#34;promoting&#34; the current request scoped instance into session scope. This is almost certainly a bug! The request scoped object will be destroyed by the container before the session ends, but the reference to the object will be left &#34;hanging&#34; in the session scope. This error will <emphasis>not</emphasis> be detected by the container, so please take extra care when returning bean instances from producer methods!"
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "There&#39;s at least three ways we could go about fixing this bug. We could change the scope of the <literal>CreditCardPaymentStrategy</literal> implementation, but this would affect other clients of that bean. A better option would be to change the scope of the producer method to <literal>@Dependent</literal> or <literal>@RequestScoped</literal>."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para

msgid "The disposer method must have at least one parameter, annotated <literal>@Disposes</literal>, with the same type and qualifiers as the producer method. The disposer method is called automatically when the context ends (in this case, at the end of the request), and this parameter receives the object produced by the producer method. If the disposer method has additional method parameters, the container will look for a bean that satisfies the type and qualifiers of each parameter and pass it to the method automatically."
