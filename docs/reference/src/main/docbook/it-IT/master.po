"Shortly before the final draft of JSR-299 was submitted, the specification "
"changed its name from &#34;Web Beans&#34; to &#34;Java Contexts and "
"Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform&#34;, abbreviated CDI. For a "
"brief period after the renaming, the reference implementation adopted the "
"name &#34;Web Beans&#34;. However, this ended up causing more confusion than"
" it solved and Red Hat decided to change the name of the reference "
"implementation to &#34;Weld&#34;. You may still find other documentation, "
"blogs, forum posts, etc. that use the old nomenclature. Please update any "
"references you can. The naming game is over."

"You&#39;ll also find that some of the functionality that once existed in the"
" specification is now missing, such as defining beans in XML. These features"
" will be available as portable extensions for CDI in the Weld project, and "
"perhaps other implementations."

"Note that this reference guide was started while changes were still being "
"made to the specification. We&#39;ve done our best to update it for "
"accuracy. If you discover a conflict between what is written in this guide "
"and the specification, the specification is the authority—assume it is "
"correct. If you believe you have found an error in the specification, please"
" report it to the JSR-299 EG."
