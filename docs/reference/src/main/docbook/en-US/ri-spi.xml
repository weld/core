   <title>Integrating Weld into other environments</title>

   <para>
      If you want to use Weld in another environment, you will need to provide certain information to Weld via the
      integration SPI. In this Appendix we will briefly discuss the steps needed.

      <title>Enterprise Services</title>
      <para>
         If you just want to use managed beans, and not take advantage of enterprise services (EE resource injection,
         CDI injection into EE component classes, transactional events, support for CDI services in EJBs) and non-flat
         deployments, then the generic servlet support provided by the "Weld: Servlets" extension will be sufficient,
         and will work in any container supporting the Servlet API.
      </para>

   <para>
      All SPIs and APIs described have extensive JavaDoc, which spell out the detailed contract between the container
      and Weld.

      <title>The Weld SPI</title>
      
      <para>
         The Weld SPI is located in the <literal>weld-spi</literal> module, and packaged as
         <literal>weld-spi.jar</literal>. Some SPIs are optional, and should only be implemented if you need to override
         the default behavior; others are required.
      </para>
       
      <para>
         All interfaces in the SPI support the decorator pattern and provide a <literal>Forwarding</literal> class
         located in the <literal>helpers</literal> sub package. Additional, commonly used, utility classes, and standard
         implementations are also located in the <literal>helpers</literal> sub package.
      </para>
                
      <para>
         Weld supports multiple environments. An environment is defined by an implementation of the
         <literal>Environment</literal> interface. A number of standard environments are built in, and described by the
         <literal>Environments</literal> enumeration. Different environments require different services to be present
         (for example a Servlet container doesn't require transaction, EJB or JPA services). By default an EE
         environment is assumed, but you can adjust the environment by calling
         <literal>bootstrap.setEnvironment()</literal>.
      </para>

      <para>
         Weld uses services to communicate with its environment. A service is a java class that implements the <literal>org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Service</literal>
         interface and is explicitly registered. A service may be BDA-specific or may be shared across the entire application.
      </para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface Service {
   public void cleanup();
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        Certain services are only used at bootstrap and need to be cleaned up afterwards in order not to consume memory.
        A service that implements the specialized <literal>org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.BootstrapService</literal> interface receives a <literal>cleanupAfterBoot()</literal>
        method invocation once Weld initialization is finished but before the deployment is put into service.
      </para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface BootstrapService extends Service {
    void cleanupAfterBoot();
}]]></programlisting>
         
      <para>
         Weld uses a generic-typed service registry to allow services to be registered. All services implement the
         <literal>Service</literal> interface. The service registry allows services to be added and retrieved.
      </para>
      
      <section>
         <title>Deployment structure</title>
      
         <para>
            An application is often comprised of a number of modules. For example, a Java EE deployment may contain a
            number of EJB modules (containing business logic) and war modules (containing the user interface). A
            container may enforce certain <emphasis>accessibility</emphasis> rules which limit the visibility of classes
            between modules. CDI allows these same rules to apply to bean and observer method resolution. As the
            accessibility rules vary between containers, Weld requires the container to <emphasis>describe</emphasis>
            the deployment structure, via the <literal>Deployment</literal> SPI.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The CDI specification discusses <emphasis>Bean Archives</emphasis> (BAs)&mdash;archives which
            are marked as containing beans which should be deployed to the CDI container, and made available for
            injection and resolution. Weld reuses this description and use <emphasis>Bean Deployment Archives</emphasis> in
            its deployment structure SPI. Each deployment exposes the containing BDAs that forms a graph; each BDA is a node in a graph,
            directed edges between nodes designate visibility, visibility is not transitive (i.e. a bean from A can only see beans in bean archives with which A is directly connected by an edge).
            Together, the transitive closure of this graph forms the beans which are deployed in the application.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            To describe the deployment structure to Weld, the container should provide an implementation of
            <literal>Deployment</literal>.  <literal>Deployment.getBeanDeploymentArchives()</literal> allows Weld to
            discover the modules which make up the application. The CDI specification also allows beans to be specified
            programmatically as part of the bean deployment. These beans may, or may not, be in an existing BDA. For
            this reason, Weld will call <literal>Deployment.loadBeanDeploymentArchive(Class clazz)</literal> for each
            programmatically described bean.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            As programmatically described beans may result in additional BDAs being added to the graph, Weld will
            discover the BDA structure every time an unknown BDA is returned by
            <literal>Deployment.loadBeanDeploymentArchive</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <title>Virtual BDAs</title>
            <para>
               In a strict container, each BDA might have to explicitly specify which other BDAs it can access. However
               many containers will allow an easy mechanism to make BDAs bi-directionally accessible (such as a library
               directory). In this case, it is allowable (and reasonable) to describe all such archives as a single,
               'virtual' <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal>.  
            </para>
            
            <para>
               A container, might, for example, use a flat accessibility structure for the application. In this case, a
               single <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal> would be attached to the <literal>Deployment</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal> provides three methods which allow it's contents to be discovered
            by Weld&mdash;<literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeanClasses()</literal> must return all the classes in the
            BDA, <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeansXml()</literal> must return a data structure representing the 
            <code>beans.xml</code> deployment descriptor for the archive, and 
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getEjbs()</literal> must provide an EJB descriptor for every EJB in the BDA,
            or an empty list if it is not an EJB archive. 
         </para>
         
         <para>
            To aid container integrator, Weld provides a built-in <code>beans.xml</code> parser. To parse a 
            <code>beans.xml</code> into the data-structure required by <code>BeanDeploymentArchive</code>, the container
            should call <code>Bootstrap.parse(URL)</code>. Weld can also parse multiple <code>beans.xml</code>
            files, merging them to become a single data-structure. This can be achieved by calling 
            <code>Bootstrap.parse(Iterable&lt;URL&gt;)</code>.
         </para>

         <para>
            When multiple <literal>beans.xml</literal> files are merged, Weld keeps duplicate enabled entries (interceptors, decorators or alternatives).
            This may cause validation problems when multiple physical archives which define an overlapping enabled entries are merged. A version of the <literal>Bootstrap.parse()</literal>
            method that provides control over whether duplicate enabled entries are remove or not is provided: <literal>Bootstrap.parse(Iterable&lt;URL&gt; urls, boolean removeDuplicates)</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            BDA X may also reference another BDA Y whose beans can be resolved by, and injected into, any bean in BDA X.
            These are the accessible BDAs, and every BDA that is directly accessible by BDA X should be returned.  A BDA
            will also have BDAs which are accessible transitively, and the transitive closure of the sub-graph of BDA X
            describes all the beans resolvable by BDA X.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <title>Matching the classloader structure for the deployment</title>
            
            <para>
               In practice, you can regard the deployment structure represented by <literal>Deployment</literal>, and
               the virtual BDA graph as a mirror of the classloader structure for a deployment. If a class can from BDA
               X can be loaded by another in BDA Y, it is accessible, and therefore BDA Y's accessible BDAs should
               include BDA X. 
            </para>
         </note>
         
         <para>
            To specify the directly accessible BDAs, the container should provide an implementation of
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeanDeploymentArchives()</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <para>
               Weld allows the container to describe a circular graph, and will convert a graph to a tree as part of the
               deployment process.
            </para>
         </note>
         
         <para>
            Certain services are provided for the whole deployment, whilst some are provided per-BDA. BDA services are
            provided using <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getServices()</literal> and only apply to the BDA on which
            they are provided.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The contract for <code>Deployment</code> requires the container to specify the portable extensions (see chapter
            12 of the CDI specification) which should be loaded by the application. To aid the container integrator, Weld
            provides the method <code>Bootstrap.loadExtensions(ClassLoader)</code> which will load the extensions for the
            specified classloader.

         <para>
            Weld delegates EJB 3 bean discovery to the container so that it doesn't duplicate the work done by the EJB
            container, and respects any vendor-extensions to the EJB definition.
         </para>
               
         <para>
            The <literal>EjbDescriptor</literal> should return the relevant metadata as defined in the EJB
            specification. Each business interface of a session bean should be described using a
            <literal>BusinessInterfaceDescriptor</literal>.
         </para>

         <title>EE resource injection and resolution services</title>
         
         <para>
            All the EE resource services are per-BDA services, and may be provided using one of two methods. Which
            method to use is at the discretion of the integrator.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The integrator may choose to provide all EE resource injection services themselves, using another library or
            framework. In this case the integrator should use the <literal>EE</literal> environment, and implement the
            <xref linkend="injection.services" /> SPI.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            Alternatively, the integrator may choose to use CDI to provide EE resource injection. In this case, the
            <literal>EE_INJECT</literal> environment should be used, and the integrator should implement the <xref
            linkend="ejb.services.resolution"/>, <xref linkend="resource.services"/> and <xref linkend="jpa.services"/>.
         </para>
         
         <important>
            <para>
               CDI only provides annotation-based EE resource injection; if you wish to provide deployment descriptor
               (e.g. <literal>ejb-jar.xml</literal>) injection, you must use <xref linkend="injection.services"/>.
            </para>
         </important>
         
         <para>
            If the container performs EE resource injection, the injected resources must be serializable. If EE resource
            injection is provided by Weld, the resolved resource must be serializable.
         </para>
          
         <tip>
            <para>
               If you use a non-EE environment then you may implement any of the EE service SPIs, and Weld will provide
               the associated functionality. There is no need to implement those services you don't need!
            </para>
         </tip>

         <para>
            Weld registers resource injection points with <literal>EjbInjectionServices</literal>, <literal>JpaInjectionServices</literal>, <literal>ResourceInjectionServices</literal> and <literal>JaxwsInjectionServices</literal> implementations
            upfront (at bootstrap). This allows validation of resource injection points to be performed at boot time rather than runtime. For each resource injection point Weld obtains a <literal>ResourceReferenceFactory</literal>
            which it then uses at runtime for creating resource references.
         </para>

        <para>
            A <literal>ResourceReference</literal> provides access to the resource reference to be injected. Furthermore, <literal>ResourceReference</literal> allows resource to be release once the bean that received resource
            injection is destroyed.

                Bytecode-scanning is used by some application servers to speed up deployment. Compared to loading a class using <literal>ClassLoader</literal>,
                bytecode-scanning allows to obtain only a subset of the Java class file metadata (e.g. annotations, class hierarchy, etc.)
                which is usually loaded much faster. This allows the container to scan all classes initially by a bytecode scanner and then use this
                limited information to decide which classes need to be fully loaded using <literal>ClassLoader</literal>. 
                <link linkend="https://github.com/wildfly/jandex">Jandex</link> is an example of a bytecode-scanning utility.

                <literal>ClassFileServices</literal> may be used by an integrator to provide container's bytecode-scanning capabilities to Weld. If present, Weld will try

            <para>
                CDI 1.1 provides a simplified approach to accessing the BeanManager / CDI container from components that do not support injection. 
                This is done by the CDI class API. The integrating part can either use <literal>org.jboss.weld.SimpleCDI</literal> provided by Weld core
                and register it using <literal>javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDIProvider</literal> file that is visible to the CDI API classes or use the
                <literal>CDI.setCDIProvider(CDIProvider provider)</literal> method method early in the deployment.
            </para>
            <para>
                Alternatively, an integrating part may provide a specialized implementation such as the one provided by
                <ulink url="https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/weld/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/weld/WeldProvider.java">WildFly integration</ulink>.

            <title>Performing CDI injection on Java EE component classes</title>
            <para>
                  The CDI specification requires the container to provide injection into non-contextual resources for
                  all Java EE component classes. Weld delegates this responsibility to the container. This can be
                  achieved using the CDI defined <literal>InjectionTarget</literal> SPI. Furthermore, you must perform
                  this operation on the correct bean manager for the bean deployment archive containing the EE component
                  class.
               </para>
               
               <para>
                  The CDI specification also requires that a <literal>ProcessInjectionTarget</literal> event is fired
                  for every Java EE component class. Furthermore, if an observer calls
                  <literal>ProcessInjectionTarget.setInjectionTarget()</literal> the container must use <emphasis>the
                  specified</emphasis> injection target to perform injection.
               </para>
               
               <para>
                  To help the integrator, Weld provides <literal>WeldManager.fireProcessInjectionTarget()</literal>
                  which returns the <literal>InjectionTarget</literal> to use.
               </para>

               <para>
                  The container may intersperse other operations between these calls. Further, the integrator may choose
                  to implement any of these calls in another manner, assuming the contract is fulfilled.

                  When performing injections on EJBs you must use the Weld-defined SPI,

                  manager for the bean deployment archive containing the EJB.

                    This optional service allows an integrator to decide if CDI contexts should be activated or not for a given HTTP request. By default, CDI contexts are always active but this hook allows an integrator to eliminate
                    the overhead of CDI context activation for certain types of requests where CDI is known not to be needed (e.g. request for a static resource).

                    by a String <literal>context id</literal>. This allows multiple Weld containers to run at the same time in environments where the TCCL cannot be used to distinguish the containers (e.g. OSGi environment).
