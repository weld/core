   <title>Integrating Weld into other environments</title>

   <para>
      If you want to use Weld in another environment, you will need to provide certain information to Weld via the
      integration SPI. In this Appendix we will briefly discuss the steps needed.

      <title>Enterprise Services</title>
      <para>
         If you just want to use managed beans, and not take advantage of enterprise services (EE resource injection,
         CDI injection into EE component classes, transactional events, support for CDI services in EJBs) and non-flat
         deployments, then the generic servlet support provided by the "Weld: Servlets" extension will be sufficient,
         and will work in any container supporting the Servlet API.
      </para>

   <para>
      All SPIs and APIs described have extensive JavaDoc, which spell out the detailed contract between the container
      and Weld.

      <title>The Weld SPI</title>
      
      <para>
         The Weld SPI is located in the <literal>weld-spi</literal> module, and packaged as
         <literal>weld-spi.jar</literal>. Some SPIs are optional, and should only be implemented if you need to override
         the default behavior; others are required.
      </para>
       
      <para>
         All interfaces in the SPI support the decorator pattern and provide a <literal>Forwarding</literal> class
         located in the <literal>helpers</literal> sub package. Additional, commonly used, utility classes, and standard
         implementations are also located in the <literal>helpers</literal> sub package.
      </para>
                
      <para>
         Weld supports multiple environments. An environment is defined by an implementation of the
         <literal>Environment</literal> interface. A number of standard environments are built in, and described by the
         <literal>Environments</literal> enumeration. Different environments require different services to be present
         (for example a Servlet container doesn't require transaction, EJB or JPA services). By default an EE
         environment is assumed, but you can adjust the environment by calling
         <literal>bootstrap.setEnvironment()</literal>.
      </para>

      <para>
         Weld uses services to communicate with its environment. A service is a java class that implements the <literal>org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.Service</literal>
         interface and is explicitly registered. A service may be BDA-specific or may be shared across the entire application.
      </para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface Service {
   public void cleanup();
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
        Certain services are only used at bootstrap and need to be cleaned up afterwards in order not to consume memory.
        A service that implements the specialized <literal>org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.BootstrapService</literal> interface receives a <literal>cleanAfterBoot()</literal>
        method invocation once Weld initialization is finished but before the deployment is put into service.
      </para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface BootstrapService extends Service {
    void cleanupAfterBoot();
}]]></programlisting>
         
      <para>
         Weld uses a generic-typed service registry to allow services to be registered. All services implement the
         <literal>Service</literal> interface. The service registry allows services to be added and retrieved.
      </para>
      
      <section>
         <title>Deployment structure</title>
      
         <para>
            An application is often comprised of a number of modules. For example, a Java EE deployment may contain a
            number of EJB modules (containing business logic) and war modules (containing the user interface). A
            container may enforce certain <emphasis>accessibility</emphasis> rules which limit the visibility of classes
            between modules. CDI allows these same rules to apply to bean and observer method resolution. As the
            accessibility rules vary between containers, Weld requires the container to <emphasis>describe</emphasis>
            the deployment structure, via the <literal>Deployment</literal> SPI.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The CDI specification discusses <emphasis>Bean Deployment Archives</emphasis> (BDAs)&mdash;archives which
            are marked as containing beans which should be deployed to the CDI container, and made available for
            injection and resolution. Weld reuses this description of <emphasis>Bean Deployment Archives</emphasis> in
            its deployment structure SPI. Each deployment exposes the BDAs which it contains; each BDA may also
            reference other which it can access. Together, the transitive closure of this graph forms the beans which
            are deployed in the application.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            To describe the deployment structure to Weld, the container should provide an implementation of
            <literal>Deployment</literal>.  <literal>Deployment.getBeanDeploymentArchives()</literal> allows Weld to
            discover the modules which make up the application. The CDI specification also allows beans to be specified
            programmatically as part of the bean deployment. These beans may, or may not, be in an existing BDA. For
            this reason, Weld will call <literal>Deployment.loadBeanDeploymentArchive(Class clazz)</literal> for each
            programmatically described bean.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            As programmatically described beans may result in additional BDAs being added to the graph, Weld will
            discover the BDA structure every time an unknown BDA is returned by
            <literal>Deployment.loadBeanDeploymentArchive</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <title>Virtual BDAs</title>
            <para>
               In a strict container, each BDA might have to explicitly specify which other BDAs it can access. However
               many containers will allow an easy mechanism to make BDAs bi-directionally accessible (such as a library
               directory). In this case, it is allowable (and reasonable) to describe all such archives as a single,
               'virtual' <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal>.  
            </para>
            
            <para>
               A container, might, for example, use a flat accessibility structure for the application. In this case, a
               single <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal> would be attached to the <literal>Deployment</literal>.
            </para>
         </note>

         <para>
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive</literal> provides three methods which allow it's contents to be discovered
            by Weld&mdash;<literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeanClasses()</literal> must return all the classes in the
            BDA, <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeansXml()</literal> must return a data structure representing the 
            <code>beans.xml</code> deployment descriptor for the archive, and 
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getEjbs()</literal> must provide an EJB descriptor for every EJB in the BDA,
            or an empty list if it is not an EJB archive. 
         </para>
         
         <para>
            To aid container integrator, Weld provides a built-in <code>beans.xml</code> parser. To parse a 
            <code>beans.xml</code> into the data-structure required by <code>BeanDeploymentArchive</code>, the container
            should call <code>Bootstrap.parse(URL)</code>. Weld can also parse multiple <code>beans.xml</code>
            files, merging them to become a single data-structure. This can be achieved by calling 
            <code>Bootstrap.parse(Iterable&lt;URL&gt;)</code>.
         </para>

         <para>
            When multiple <literal>beans.xml</literal> files are merged, Weld keeps duplicate enabled entries (interceptors, decorators or alternatives).
            This may cause validation problems when multiple physical archives which define an overlapping enabled entries are merged. A version of the <literal>Bootstrap.parse()</literal>
            method that provides control over whether duplicate enabled entries are remove or not is provided: <literal>Bootstrap.parse(Iterable&lt;URL&gt; urls, boolean removeDuplicates)</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            BDA X may also reference another BDA Y whose beans can be resolved by, and injected into, any bean in BDA X.
            These are the accessible BDAs, and every BDA that is directly accessible by BDA X should be returned.  A BDA
            will also have BDAs which are accessible transitively, and the transitive closure of the sub-graph of BDA X
            describes all the beans resolvable by BDA X.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <title>Matching the classloader structure for the deployment</title>
            
            <para>
               In practice, you can regard the deployment structure represented by <literal>Deployment</literal>, and
               the virtual BDA graph as a mirror of the classloader structure for a deployment. If a class can from BDA
               X can be loaded by another in BDA Y, it is accessible, and therefore BDA Y's accessible BDAs should
               include BDA X. 
            </para>
         </note>
         
         <para>
            To specify the directly accessible BDAs, the container should provide an implementation of
            <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getBeanDeploymentArchives()</literal>.
         </para>
         
         <note>
            <para>
               Weld allows the container to describe a circular graph, and will convert a graph to a tree as part of the
               deployment process.
            </para>
         </note>
         
         <para>
            Certain services are provided for the whole deployment, whilst some are provided per-BDA. BDA services are
            provided using <literal>BeanDeploymentArchive.getServices()</literal> and only apply to the BDA on which
            they are provided.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The contract for <code>Deployment</code> requires the container to specify the portable extensions (see chapter
            12 of the CDI specification) which should be loaded by the application. To aid the container integrator, Weld
            provides the method <code>Bootstrap.loadExtensions(ClassLoader)</code> which will load the extensions for the
            specified classloader.

         <para>
            Weld delegates EJB 3 bean discovery to the container so that it doesn't duplicate the work done by the EJB
            container, and respects any vendor-extensions to the EJB definition.
         </para>
               
         <para>
            The <literal>EjbDescriptor</literal> should return the relevant metadata as defined in the EJB
            specification. Each business interface of a session bean should be described using a
            <literal>BusinessInterfaceDescriptor</literal>.
         </para>

       <section>
         <title>EE resource injection and resolution services</title>
         
         <para>
            All the EE resource services are per-BDA services, and may be provided using one of two methods. Which
            method to use is at the discretion of the integrator.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            The integrator may choose to provide all EE resource injection services themselves, using another library or
            framework. In this case the integrator should use the <literal>EE</literal> environment, and implement the
            <xref linkend="injection.services" /> SPI.
         </para>
         
         <para>
            Alternatively, the integrator may choose to use CDI to provide EE resource injection. In this case, the
            <literal>EE_INJECT</literal> environment should be used, and the integrator should implement the <xref
            linkend="ejb.services.resolution"/>, <xref linkend="resource.services"/> and <xref linkend="jpa.services"/>.
         </para>
         
         <important>
            <para>
               CDI only provides annotation-based EE resource injection; if you wish to provide deployment descriptor
               (e.g. <literal>ejb-jar.xml</literal>) injection, you must use <xref linkend="injection.services"/>.
            </para>
         </important>
         
         <para>
            If the container performs EE resource injection, the injected resources must be serializable. If EE resource
            injection is provided by Weld, the resolved resource must be serializable.
         </para>
          
         <tip>
            <para>
               If you use a non-EE environment then you may implement any of the EE service SPIs, and Weld will provide
               the associated functionality. There is no need to implement those services you don't need!
            </para>
         </tip>

         <para>
            Weld registers resource injection points with <literal>EjbInjectionServices</literal>, <literal>JpaInjectionServices</literal> and <literal>ResourceInjectionServices</literal> implementations
            upfront (at bootstrap). This allows validation of resource injection points to be performed at boot time rather than runtime. For each resource injection point Weld obtains a <literal>ResourceReferenceFactory</literal>
            which it then uses at runtime for creating resource references.
         </para>

         <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public interface ResourceReferenceFactory<T> {
    ResourceReference<T> createResource();
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            A <literal>ResourceReference</literal> provides access to the resource reference to be injected. Furthermore, <literal>ResourceReference</literal> allows resource to be release once the bean that received resource
            injection is destroyed.

                  achieved using the CDI defined <literal>InjectionTarget</literal> SPI. Furthermore, you must perform

                  <literal>ProcessInjectionTarget.setInjectionTarget()</literal> the container must use <emphasis>the
