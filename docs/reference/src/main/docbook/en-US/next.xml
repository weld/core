      A lot of additional information on CDI can be found online. Regardless, the CDI specification remains the authority for information on CDI. The spec is less than 100 pages and 
      is quite readable (don't worry, it's not like your Blu-ray player manual). Of course, it covers many details we've 
      skipped over here. The spec is available on the at the JCP website (<ulink url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299">CDI 1.0</ulink>) (<ulink url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346">CDI 1.1</ulink>).

      The CDI reference implementation, Weld, is being developed by the <ulink url="http://seamframework.org/Weld/Home#H-MaintainersAndContributors">Weld
      team</ulink>. The team and the CDI spec lead blog at <ulink
      url="http://in.relation.to">in.relation.to</ulink>. This guide was originally based on a series of blog entries
      published there while the specification was being developed. It's probably the best source of information about
      the future of CDI and Weld.
