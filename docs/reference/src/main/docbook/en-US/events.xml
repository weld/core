   <title>Events</title>

   <para>
      Dependency injection enables loose-coupling by allowing the implementation of the injected bean type to vary,
      either a deployment time or runtime. Events go one step further, allowing beans to interact with no compile
      time dependency at all. Event <emphasis>producers</emphasis> raise events that are delivered to event 
      <emphasis>observers</emphasis> by the container.
   </para>

   <para>This basic schema might sound like the familiar observer/observable pattern, but there are a couple of 
   twists:</para>
   
   <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>not only are event producers decoupled from observers; observers are completely decoupled from 
         producers,</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            observers can specify a combination of "selectors" to narrow the set of event notifications they will 
            receive, and
         </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>
            observers can be notified immediately, or can specify that delivery of the event should be delayed until 
            the  end of the current transaction.
         </para>
      </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
      
   <para>The CDI event notification facility uses more or less the same typesafe approach that we've already 
   seen with the dependency injection service.</para>
   
   <section>
      <title>Event payload</title>
      
      <para>
         The event object carries state from producer to consumer. The event object is nothing more than an instance of 
         a concrete Java class. (The only restriction is that an event type may not contain type variables). An event 
         may be assigned qualifiers, which allows observers to distinguish it from other events of the same type. The 
         qualifiers function like topic selectors, allowing an observer to narrow the set of events it observes.
      </para>

      <para>
         An event qualifier is just a normal qualifier, defined using <literal>@Qualifier</literal>. Here's an example:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Target({FIELD, PARAMETER})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Updated {}]]></programlisting>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Event observers</title>

      <para>
         An <emphasis>observer method</emphasis> is a method of a bean with a parameter annotated
         <literal>@Observes</literal>.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void onAnyDocumentEvent(@Observes Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         The annotated parameter is called the <emphasis>event parameter</emphasis>. The type of the event parameter is
         the observed <emphasis>event type</emphasis>, in this case <literal>Document</literal>. The event parameter may
         also specify qualifiers.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void afterDocumentUpdate(@Observes @Updated Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         An observer method need not specify any event qualifiers&mdash;in this case it is interested in
         <emphasis>only unqualified</emphasis> events of a particular type. If it does specify qualifiers, it's only interested
         in events which have those qualifiers.
      </para>

      <para>
         The observer method may have additional parameters, which are injection points:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void afterDocumentUpdate(@Observes @Updated Document document, User user) { ... }]]></programlisting>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Event producers</title>

      <para>
         Event producers fire events using an instance of the parameterized <literal>Event</literal> interface.
         An instance of this interface is obtained by injection:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Any Event<Document> documentEvent;]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         A producer raises events by calling the <literal>fire()</literal> method of the <literal>Event</literal>
         interface, passing the event object:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[documentEvent.fire(document);]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         This particular event will be delivered to every observer method that:
      </para>
  
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>has an event parameter to which the event object (the <literal>Document</literal>) is assignable, 
          and</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>specifies no qualifiers.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
  
      <para>
         The container simply calls all the observer methods, passing the event object as the value of the event
         parameter. If any observer method throws an exception, the container stops calling observer methods, and the
         exception is rethrown by the <literal>fire()</literal> method.
      </para>

      <para>
         Qualifiers can be applied to an event in one of two ways:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>by annotating the <literal>Event</literal> injection point, or</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>by passing qualifiers to the <literal>select()</literal> of <literal>Event</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         Specifying the qualifiers at the injection point is far simpler:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Updated Event<Document> documentUpdatedEvent;]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Then, every event fired via this instance of <literal>Event</literal> has the event qualifier
         <literal>@Updated</literal>. The event is delivered to every observer method that:
      </para>
  
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>has an event parameter to which the event object is assignable, and</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               does not have any event qualifier <emphasis>except</emphasis> for the event qualifiers that match 
               those specified at the <literal>Event</literal> injection point. 
            </para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         The downside of annotating the injection point is that we can't specify the qualifier dynamically. CDI 
         lets us obtain a qualifier instance by subclassing the helper class <literal>AnnotationLiteral</literal>. 
         That way, we can pass the qualifier to the <literal>select()</literal> method of <literal>Event</literal>.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[documentEvent.select(new AnnotationLiteral<Updated>(){}).fire(document);]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Events can have multiple event qualifiers, assembled using any combination of annotations at the 
         <literal>Event</literal> injection point and qualifier instances passed to the <literal>select()</literal> 
         method.
      </para>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Conditional observer methods</title>

      <para>
         By default, if there is no instance of an observer in the current context, the container will instantiate the 
         observer in order to deliver an event to it. This behavior isn't always desirable. We may want to deliver events 
         only to instances of the observer that already exist in the current contexts.
      </para>

      <para>
         A conditional observer is specified by adding <literal>receive = IF_EXISTS</literal> to the <literal>@Observes</literal> 
         annotation.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void refreshOnDocumentUpdate(@Observes(receive = IF_EXISTS) @Updated Document d) { ... }]]></programlisting> 

      <para>
         A bean with scope <literal>@Dependent</literal> cannot be a conditional observer, since it would never be called!
      </para>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Event qualifiers with members</title>

      <para>An event qualifier type may have annotation members:</para>

<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Qualifier
@Target({PARAMETER, FIELD})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Role {
   RoleType value();
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>The member value is used to narrow the messages delivered to the observer:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void adminLoggedIn(@Observes @Role(ADMIN) LoggedIn event) { ... }]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Event qualifier type members may be specified statically by the event producer, via annotations at the event
         notifier injection point:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Role(ADMIN) Event<LoggedIn> loggedInEvent;]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Alternatively, the value of the event qualifier type member may be determined dynamically by the event
         producer. We start by writing an abstract subclass of <literal>AnnotationLiteral</literal>:
      </para>
  
<programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[abstract class RoleBinding 
   extends AnnotationLiteral<Role> 
   implements Role {}]]></programlisting>
    
      <para>The event producer passes an instance of this class to <literal>select()</literal>:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[documentEvent.select(new RoleBinding() {
   public void value() { return user.getRole(); }
}).fire(document);]]></programlisting>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Multiple event qualifiers</title>

      <para>Event qualifier types may be combined, for example:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Inject @Blog Event<Document> blogEvent;
...
if (document.isBlog()) blogEvent.select(new AnnotationLiteral<Updated>(){}).fire(document);]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         Observers must completely match the final qualified type of the event. Assume the following observers in this example:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void afterBlogUpdate(@Observes @Updated @Blog Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void afterDocumentUpdate(@Observes @Updated Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void onAnyBlogEvent(@Observes @Blog Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void onAnyDocumentEvent(@Observes Document document) { ... }}}]]></programlisting>

      <para>The only observer notified will be:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void afterBlogUpdate(@Observes @Updated @Blog Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>

      <para>However, if there were also an observer:</para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void afterBlogUpdate(@Observes @Any Document document) { ... }]]></programlisting>

      <para>It would also be notified, as <literal>@Any</literal> acts as an alias for any and all qualifiers.</para>

   </section>

   <section>
      <title>Transactional observers</title>

      <para>
         Transactional observers receive their event notifications during the before or after completion phase of the
         transaction in which the event was raised. For example, the following observer method needs to refresh a query
         result set that is cached in the application context, but only when transactions that update the
         <literal>Category</literal> tree succeed:
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[public void refreshCategoryTree(@Observes(during = AFTER_SUCCESS) CategoryUpdateEvent event) { ... }]]></programlisting>

      <para>There are five kinds of transactional observers:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <literal>IN_PROGESS</literal> observers are called immediately (default)
            </para>
            <para>
               <literal>AFTER_SUCCESS</literal> observers are called during the after completion phase of the
               transaction, but only if the transaction completes successfully
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <literal>AFTER_FAILURE</literal> observers are called during the after completion phase of the
               transaction, but only if the transaction fails to complete successfully
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <literal>AFTER_COMPLETION</literal> observers are called during the after completion phase of
               the transaction
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <literal>BEFORE_COMPLETION</literal> observers are called during the before completion phase
               of the transaction
            </para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
         Transactional observers are very important in a stateful object model because state is often held for 
         longer  than a single atomic transaction.
      </para>
  
      <para>Imagine that we have cached a JPA query result set in the application scope:</para>
  
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@ApplicationScoped @Singleton
public class Catalog {

   @PersistenceContext EntityManager em;
    
   List<Product> products;

   @Produces @Catalog 
   List<Product> getCatalog() {
      if (products==null) {
         products = em.createQuery("select p from Product p where p.deleted = false")
            .getResultList();
      }
      return products;
   }
    
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         From time to time, a <literal>Product</literal> is created or deleted. When this occurs, we need to refresh the
         <literal>Product</literal> catalog. But we should wait until <emphasis>after</emphasis> the transaction
         completes successfully before performing this refresh!
      </para>
  
      <para>
         The bean that creates and deletes <literal>Product</literal>s could raise events, for example:
      </para>
  
     <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@Stateless
public class ProductManager {
   @PersistenceContext EntityManager em;
   @Inject @Any Event<Product> productEvent;

   public void delete(Product product) {
      em.delete(product);
      productEvent.select(new AnnotationLiteral<Deleted>(){}).fire(product);
   }
    
   public void persist(Product product) {
      em.persist(product);
      productEvent.select(new AnnotationLiteral<Created>(){}).fire(product);
   }
   ...
}]]></programlisting>

      <para>
         And now <literal>Catalog</literal> can observe the events after successful completion of the transaction:
      </para>
  
  <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@ApplicationScoped @Singleton
public class Catalog {
   ...
   void addProduct(@Observes(during = AFTER_SUCCESS) @Created Product product) {
      products.add(product);
   }
    
   void removeProduct(@Observes(during = AFTER_SUCCESS) @Deleted Product product) {
      products.remove(product);
   }
}]]></programlisting>
