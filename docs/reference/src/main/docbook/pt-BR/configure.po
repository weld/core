"In this tutorial, we'll explore this feature via an example; a more formal "

"In this example we show the most common use cases for exercising fine "
"control over which classes Weld scans. The first filter excludes all classes "
"in the package <code>com.acme.swing</code>, and in most cases this will be "
"sufficient for your needs."

"However, sometimes it's useful to be able to activate the filter depending "
"on the environment used. In this case, Weld allows you to activate (or "
"deactivate) a filter based on either system properties or whether a class is "
"available. The second filter shows the use case of disabling scanning of "
"certain classes depending on the capabilities of the environment you deploy "
"to - in this case we are excluding GWT support if GWT is not installed."

"Notice how we use a <code>!</code> character on the <code>name</code> "

"The third filter uses a regular expression to select the classes to match "
"(normally we use simple name-based patterns, as they don't require us to "

"If you specify just a system property name, Weld will activate the filter if "
"that system property has been set (with any value). If you also specify the "
"system property value, then Weld will only activate the filter if the system "
"property's value matches exactly."

"The fourth filter shows more a advanced configurations, where we use "
"multiple activation conditions to decide whether to activate the filter."

"You can combine as many activation conditions as you like (<emphasis>all</"
"emphasis> must be true for the filter to be activated). If you want to a "
"filter that is active if <emphasis>any</emphasis> of the activation "
"conditions are true, then you need multiple identical filters, each with "
"different activation conditions."
