"When you first start developing with CDI, you'll likely be dealing only with"
" a single bean implementation for each bean type. In this case, it's easy to"
" understand how beans get selected for injection. As the complexity of your "
"application grows, multiple occurrences of the same bean type start "
"appearing, either because you have multiple implementations or two beans "
"share a common (Java) inheritance. That's when you have to begin studying "
"the specialization, inheritance and alternative rules to work through "
"unsatisfied or ambiguous dependencies or to avoid certain beans from being "
"called."
