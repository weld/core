[preface]
= A note about this document

This document is meant as a complimentary source of information to the
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0.html[CDI specification].
It doesn't cover all general parts of CDI, instead it goes more in-depth in certain areas
and also explains many areas in which Weld offers certain non-portable configurations and
behavior on top of what CDI defines.

It also shows some simple setup examples for user applications and talks a bit about how to
integrate Weld into various environments.

The document is divided into many separate parts and chapters for ease of read and navigation.
